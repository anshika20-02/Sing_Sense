                        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                        <p>This project aims to develop an AI-powered system to recognize sign language gestures and translate them into text and speech. Our goal is to bridge the communication gap between individuals who use sign language and those who do not, promoting inclusivity and accessibility..</p>

                        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
                        <p>Sign language users face communication barriers in various settings, such as healthcare, education, and daily social interactions. This project focuses on leveraging AI technology to provide a real-time translation system that can interpret sign language into readable text and audible speech.</p>

                        <h2>The challenge Project</h2>
                        <p>Data Augmentation: Collecting enough data for accurate recognition was challenging, especially for certain gestures. <br>
                            Real-Time Processing: Optimizing the system for real-time performance required significant model tuning and backend integration. <br>
                            Multiple Sign Language Support: Implementing support for different sign languages (ASL and ISL) involved training separate models and managing their integration.</p>

                                    <p><b>1. Data Collection:</b> <br>We collected datasets for various sign language gestures, focusing on ASL (American Sign Language) and ISL (Indian Sign Language).</p>
                                    <p><b>2. Data Preprocessing:</b> <br>Resizing Images: Ensuring uniformity in the dimensions of gesture images. <br>
                                        Augmentation: Enhancing the dataset by rotating, flipping, and adjusting brightness. <br>
                                        Splitting the Data: Dividing the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets for robust model training.</p>
                                    <p><b>3. Model Development:</b> <br> Using TensorFlow and Keras, we built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The model was trained to accurately recognize and classify hand gestures from the preprocessed dataset.</p>
                                    <p><b>4. Model Integration:</b> <br> We integrated the trained model into the web application using Flask. The backend processes live video input, runs the model inference, and sends the recognized gesture to the frontend for display and speech conversion.</p>
                                    <p><b>5. Testing & Validation:</b> <br>The system was rigorously tested with both ASL and ISL gestures. We evaluated the model's accuracy and made performance optimizations for real-time recognition.</p>
                                    <p><b>6. Deployment:</b> <br>The application was deployed on PythonAnywhere, allowing users to access the system through a web browser. We optimized the system to handle real-time gesture recognition efficiently.</p>
